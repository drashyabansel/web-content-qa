# Web Content Q&A Tool (UI-Focused)
A web-based tool where a user can enter one or more URLs, then ask questions based on the information from those pagesâ€”without relying on general knowledge. The tool should have a minimal, user-friendly interface (e.g., a single-page web app or hosted link) where we can:
Input URLs to ingest their text/content. 
Ask questions about that content. 
View concise, accurate answers using only the ingested information.
